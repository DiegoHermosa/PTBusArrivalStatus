# Capstone: Bus Arrival Status to Stop 
### Business Understanding: ### 
Can the Public Tranportation Bus Arrival to Stop be predicted as On Time, Early Or Late?

### Data: ### 
The data comes from the Public Trasportation History database that the company I work for has develop. 
I've created the dataset applying the filters to extract bus arrival to stop data for a single Stop and for a date range of 3 months(April-2024 to June-2024).

The data can be found in this link
